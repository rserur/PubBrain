Project Questions and Answers
-------------------------------

1. The person who will use my project is:

	A clinical researcher (at any level: student, coordinator, clinician, or PI) who is informally exploring brain regions and topics of interest associated with them.

2. (S/he) will be happy my project exists if:

	It quickly yields insights and links to articles (via PubMed or Google Scholar) that they would otherwise not as easily happen upon. It displays quick facts about each region and a few article search results based on the user's selections.

3. The first 10 minutes of using/interacting with my project will look like:

	- Hovering over the brain manipulates it visually, making more prominent (larger, color changed) whichever region is hovered upon.

	- Clicking the brain will make a selection.

	- A brief description (maybe with little facts) of the region will display on the page.

	- The user will be prompted to select other optional search terms, such as diagnosis or keywords like developmental, health, personality, etc.

	- A search button (or automatically generated area) returns articles based on the region selected and other search terms.


4. By the end of tonight, I'd like to be able to:

	Use D3 to highlight a region as a selection when you click it.
