State of the Final Project: 5/8/2014
=====================================

**What state do you want the project to be in 7 days from now?**

Its basic functionality is actually very close to what I envisoned my end goal, in that the API and SVG are now responsive to simple user actions like hovering and clicking. The search results end up being pretty interesting.

There are a few quirks to weed through (as detailed and updated in my TODO.md file) that would probably add up to a lot time-wise, so for the next few days I'd like to prioritize and focus on making the page feel like more than just one reactive picture. 

I took a little too much time to draw this svg and clean it up for this usage, but maybe I can figure out a simple, less pretty visual substitute for what I'm planning: I want to add a switch to superimpose or shift to the midsagittal or medial view(s) of the brain for additional, more important regions like the amygdala or thalamus.

The visuals are important to me in the user experience, so I'd really love to hone them as much as possible as well.

**What state do you want the project to be in 4 hours from now?**

It would be worthwhile to try adding a very rough version of that switch view described above, even if I won't have an ideal SVG yet.
